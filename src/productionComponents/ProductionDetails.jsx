    description:
      "We always wanted to make our sweaters as compact as possible for maximum durability. After we’d designed the Sailor Turtleneck, we had long discussions with our knitters in Italy who suggested adding more wool to the machine. That led to the Navy Turtleneck, inspired by military clothing from the 30s and 40s. The full cardigan knit with gauge 5 makes it more heavy duty than our Sailor styles but the other details  – the symmetrical shape, our signature thumb-holes and the use of the triangle in the neckline to create a more fitted shape – remain the same. The ability of our Italian knitters to add the triangle at the neckline meant we could also produce a crewneck where the collar was knitted in place, rather than sewn on afterwards. That led to our third style – our iconic Navy Crewneck. ",

    description:
      "Our first style from 2010, the Sailor Turtleneck, was inspired by a vintage Danish sailor sweater. It is, however, distinguished by several essential details, including a tuck stitch on the rib that reinforces the half-cardigan knit and thumb holes for warmth. We improved the traditional symmetrical shape by embedding a knitted triangle at the neckline. This is a crucial design element because the sweater is precisely the same, both front and back and requires this extra piece to fit the body well.",

    description:
      "We wanted to make a lighter sailor sweater that referenced the classic Guernsey style. The goal was to keep the same compactness as our Navy and Sailor series but with a less heavy-duty feel. That led to our Seaman Crewneck, Turtleneck and Half-zip. Each one features a T-sleeve, our signature thumb-holes, no pattern, and a rib on the bottom hem. The shoulder has a deliberately visible seam.",

    description:
      "When we opened our flagship, we wanted to offer our customers something for every season, which lead to our first cotton piece the Boatsman. It’s symmetrical in shape, just like our core wool styles but other details set it apart. It has a slightly cropped sleeve length and straight armholes that give it its characteristic T-shape. Like all of our styles, our cotton pieces are knitted fully fashioned so there are no raw edges.",

      "Our signature yarn is made exclusively for us at an Italian spinning mill using mulesing-free, 100% pure new wool sourced from Corriedale sheep in Patagonia and Uruguay. Corriedales were first bred in New Zealand 150 years ago when Scottish sheep farmer James Little deliberately bred Merino and Lincoln sheep to create a more robust and all-purpose animal that produces high quality long-fibred wool.",

    description:
      "This natural-coloured, 100% pure new wool from brown sheep has been carefully selected to achieve a rich colour with beautifully subtle variations from garment to garment. The sheep are sheared and the wool is cleansed and ​worsted to remove broken and short fibres​. Finally, it’s spun using the same specifications as both of our signature yarns.",

      "Our indigo yarn is ​fibre-dyed​ using natural indigo leaves harvested in France and India that are then combined with selected herbs. After dyeing, the fibres are worsted to remove broken and short fibres. The yarn is then spun onto cones, ready for knitting. We’ve partnered with the only dye house in the world that has a ​Woolmark certificate​ for their herb-dyeing process.",

    name: "Our Knitting Mill",

    category: "production",
    title: "Production",
    description:"We produce our garments at a mill in the Veneto region of northern Italy that employs only the most highly skilled knitters. Everything is knitted on flat knitting machines in gauges 5, 7, or 12 depending on the style. We knit as compactly as possible to ensure maximum durability. Every part of every garment is fully fashioned, which means they are knitted in shape. This keeps waste to a minimum and increases the garments’ longevity as there are no raw edges to unravel. Production at the mill is powered almost entirely by solar energy."

    title: "Production",
    description:"Linking is a process in which each garment is knitted together on specialised linking machines. To ensure the perfect match, the linker creates each layer loop by loop on the machine. It’s a painstaking, highly skilled process but it ensures the seams of every garment are both more flexible and durable. And it’s why the seams of every Andersen-Andersen garment are guaranteed to last a lifetime. After linking, bar-tack stitches are attached to further strengthen and reinforce."

This helps reveal any inconsistencies and ensures that every piece that reaches the market is perfect. The inner labels are then attached and the garment is steamed and inspected one last time. Finally, the hang-tags are attached, and the garment is packed ahead of its onward journey out into the world."
